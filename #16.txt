A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.

He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?

A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Mine
var isSquare = function(n){
  if (Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n))) {
      return true;
      }
  return false; // fix me
}

The Best

function isSquare(n) {
  return Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0;
}
